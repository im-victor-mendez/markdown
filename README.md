### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

This application/site was created as a project to a [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) certification. The [project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

### Users can:
- [x] See a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

- [x] See an element with a corresponding id="preview".

- [x] When user enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

- [x] When user enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

- [x] When user's markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

- [x] When user's markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

- [x] Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): User's markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
